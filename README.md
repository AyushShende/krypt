# Application Brief

I have built this web3 app where one can send ether to different wallets.
Firstly you need to connect your metamask wallet.
Then you can initiate a transaction.
Latest transactions are visible along with gifs for the keyword provided

# Technologies Used

Client - React, Vite, Tailwind, ethers.
SmartContract - Solidity, hardhat.

# How to use the code.

Clone the repo.
Make the required env files in both client and smart_contract folders, the sample env file is already there.
Use npm run dev on the client side to start the application.
You can use - "npx hardhat run scripts/fileName --network testNetworkName" command to deploy the smart contract.
I am using Alchemy for deployment.
I have used giphy for gifs.
